        <p>
            We Started 50% Greener because we wanted to bring attention to the City of Vancouver's Climate Emergeny Action Plan's goal to reduce current carbon emissions by 50% by 2030 and to be carbon neutral by 2050.
        </p>
        <p>
            That's why we started developing our app, 50% Greener. A carbon footprint calculator designed to keep track of your carbon footprint and bring fun and intuitive ways to develop long lasting changes to our habits for a greener future.
        </p>
        <p>
            We want to be 50% greener and hope you come along for the ride.
