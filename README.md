## General Info

This is a single-page web application design to promote awareness of one's environmental impact and help them to reduce it.

Problem: Climate emergency plan needs involvement from the community to meet goals set by the City. People want to participate but don't know how and needs an easy way to visualize and track their own emission levels as well as city-wide goals.

Solution: 50% Greener allows users to measure their initial carbon emissions score and then set a goal for reducing their carbon emissions and lowering their score. Users can check off tasks relating to ways in which they reduce their environmental impact, thus lowering their carbon emissions score.
